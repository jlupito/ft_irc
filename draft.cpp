Rappel :

The IRC protocol includes a special type of message called a reply. When a client sends
a command to a server, the server will send a reply (except in a few special commands where
a reply should not be expected). Replies are used to acknowledge that a command was processed
correctly, to indicate errors, or to provide information when the command performs a server
query (e.g., asking for the list of users or channels).
A reply is a message with the following characteristics:
- It always includes a prefix.
- The command will be a three-digit code. The full list of possible replies is specified
in [RFC2812 ยง5].
- The first parameter is always the target of the reply, typically a nick.
Examples :
:irc.example.com 433 * borja :Nickname is already in use.
:irc.example.org 332 borja #cmsc23300 :A channel for CMSC 23300 students
